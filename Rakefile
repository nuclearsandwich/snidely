Snidely was born of frustration managing dotfiles between Linux machines and OS
X machines and between desktops with large monitors and laptops with small ones.

It's designed to make portable configs a single command endeavor and allow for
as litle or as much per-setup tweaking as possible. All with as little logic as
it can get away with.
